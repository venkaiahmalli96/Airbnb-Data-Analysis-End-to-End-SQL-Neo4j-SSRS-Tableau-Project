# Airbnb Data Analysis – End-to-End SQL, Neo4j, SSRS & Tableau Project
  This project was completed as part of the “Data Storage Solutions for Data Analytics” module at Dublin Business School (Lecturer: Dr Anesu Nyabadza)
   Developed by Venkaiah Malli.

## 📌 Project Overview 
This project showcases my skills as a **Data Analyst** by delivering a complete **end-to-end data analysis workflow** using an Airbnb dataset.  
It combines **data modeling, advanced querying, reporting, and dashboard visualization** across multiple platforms: **SQL, Neo4j, SSRS, and Tableau**.  
The goal was to transform raw Airbnb data into actionable business insights through clean design, accurate analysis, and professional reporting.
